WHY TO USE VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS

  Version Control systems are used to save different versions of files as they 
  change through time. VC systems allow us to restore older versions of files
  or compare them between different versions.VC systems also optimizes storage
  of these versioned files so they are not same as saving each versions of the 
  files as they are in seperate directories. They save difference between files.

DIFF COMMAND AND USAGE
  diff: This command allows us to compare two different files and show 
  differences. Example usage is like this

/code
  diff game_old.js game_new.js
/code

And the output of diff looks like this

/code
  7d6
  <   13: 'enter',
  9a9
  >   38: 'up',
  395c395
  <     if (KEY_STATUS.spacr) {
  ---
  >     if (KEY_STATUS.up) {
  409c409
  <     if (KEY_STATUS.enter) {
  ---
  >     if (KEY_STATUS.space) {
  922c922
  <         KEY_STATUS.space = false; // hack so we don't move right away
  ---
  >         KEY_STATUS.space = false; // hack so we don't shoot right away
/code
Note: I do not understand how to extract information from the text block above.
But I will update this note later when I understood analyzing diff text.

QUESTION 1:
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you 
a more efficient programmer in the long term?
ANSWER:
Being able to access history of a file allows to remember certain decisions
if these are also supported by documentation(commenting in source code etc).
It also helps to find the reason for suddenly malfunctioning program by 
reverting back to working versions.Once we recognize the fault injecting 
version; it is easy to find and fix the source with the <diff> tool.
