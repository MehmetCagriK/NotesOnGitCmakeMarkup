# Reflections

## Introduction

This workplace is created to hold files used for Git-GitHub classes of Udacity
in a version control system.

## Directory Structure
There is a `reflections` directory under this directory. It includes a plain
text file that contains reflections (thoughts on new information learned).
There is also a `git.txt` file which is a sandbox for testing git system.
